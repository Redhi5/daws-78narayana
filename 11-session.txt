variables
data types
conditions
functions
loops

functions
-----------
it is block of code that can do some work. It accepts inputs too...

FUNC_NAME(){

}

FUNC_NAME

variable, any value repeated inside code can be declared as a variable. declaring variables is a best practice even it is repeating only 1 time.

similary if a a block code is repeating, consider using functions..


logs
------
we should persist/store the logs of any coding, this is the best practice.

Redirections
----------
> --> by default only success output will be redirected... # Example of rrrrr > output.log
1 --> success                                              # Example of " rrrrr 1> output.log "                              
2 --> Error                                                # Example of " rrrrr 2> output.log "
& --> Both success and error                               # Example of " rrrrr &> output.log " , cat output.log , ls -l &> output.log
>> --> append                                              # Example of " rrrrr &>> output.log " , " cat output.log "
there should be no space b/w & and >
&>> --> append both success and error                      # Example of " rrrrr &>> output.log " , " cat output.log "... 
                                         
cat > file-name
cat >> 
Example " rm -rf  output.log "
sudo dnf remove mysql -y
sudo dnf remove git -y
sudo dnf install git -y
colors
------------
1) To print colored text, enter the following command:
    A script can use escape sequences to produce colored text on the terminal.
    Colors for text are represented by color codes, including,
    31 --> red color
    32 --> green
    33 --> yellow
   syntex: \e[31m --> red color
   echo -e "\e[31m Hello world."
   echo -e "\e[31m Hello \e[35world."
 
   
        Example "reset = 0, black = 30, red = 31,
                 green = 32, yellow = 33, blue = 34, 
                 magenta = 35, cyan = 36, white = 37."
               syntex: echo -e "\e[1;31m This is red text \e[0m"
    * Here, \e[1;31m is the escape string to set the color to red and 
      \e[0m resets the color back. Replace 31 with the required color code.             

2) To print a colored background, enter the following command:
    For a colored background, reset = 0, black = 40, red = 41, 
                              green = 42, yellow = 43, blue = 44,
                              magenta = 45, cyan = 46, and white=47, are the commonly used color codes. 

     syntex: echo -e "\e[1;42m ...         
loops
-----------
for(int i=0; i<20; i++){
	print $i;
}


mysql
gcc
chrony
fail2ban
postgis2_94

steps
-----------
log redirection
colors are mandatory

1. user have root access or not
2. send packages to install as parameters
sudo sh install-packages mysql gcc docker 

special variable to get all params --> $@
