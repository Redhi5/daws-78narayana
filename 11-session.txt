variables
data types
conditions
functions
loops

functions
-----------
it is block of code that can do some work. It accepts inputs too...

FUNC_NAME(){

}

FUNC_NAME

variable, any value repeated inside code can be declared as a variable. declaring variables is a best practice even it is repeating only 1 time.

similary if a a block code is repeating, consider using functions..


logs
------
we should persist/store the logs of any coding, this is the best practice.

Redirections
----------
> --> by default only success output will be redirected... # Example of rrrrr > output.log
1 --> success         # Example of " rrrrr 1> output.log "                              
2 --> Error           # Example of " rrrrr 2> output.log "
& --> Both success and error   # Example of " rrrrr &> output.log " , cat output.log , ls -l &> output.log
>> --> append           # Example of " rrrrr &>> output.log " , " cat output.log "
there should be no space b/w & and >
&>> --> append both success and error   # Example of " rrrrr &>> output.log " , " cat output.log "... 
                                         
cat > file-name
cat >> 
Example " rm -rf  output.log "
colors
------------
31 --> red color
32 --> green
33 --> yellow

\e[31m --> red color

loops
-----------
for(int i=0; i<20; i++){
	print $i;
}


mysql
gcc
chrony
fail2ban
postgis2_94

steps
-----------
log redirection
colors are mandatory

1. user have root access or not
2. send packages to install as parameters
sudo sh install-packages mysql gcc docker 

special variable to get all params --> $@
